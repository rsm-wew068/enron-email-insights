Mark, I am distributing to your attention since the structure involves the buying/selling of inventory in a trading arrangement, and the documents are in some respects derived from an ISDA format. While this is a ""financing"" with a bank, and hence my involvement, there are trading aspects here as well. Mike Robison is reviewing from the EWS business unit perspective.If someone in your group should review, please advise. Justin, I am distributing to your attention, since the choice of law is English, and you were involved in the prior Metals transaction that this is derived from. If someone else in London should review, please advise. -----Original Message----- From: Sitlani, Deepak mailto:deepak.sitlani@linklaters.com Sent: Friday, July 20, 2001 10:20 AM To: Ghosh, Soma; Ephross, Joel; Liu, Ying; Brian Smith (E-mail); Richard Firth (E-mail); 'Martin.Woodhams@barclayscapital.com' Cc: Firth, Simon N; Lee, Gareth Subject: Enron/Barclays Global Markets Inventory Financing Please find attached first drafts of: 1 the Master Agreement; 2 the Forward Sale Agreement; and 3 the Agency Agreement. 00300601EnronCorpDES.doc 010702ForwardSaleAgreemntDES.doc 010702DESEnronAgencyAgreement.doc For ease of review, I also attach: 1 the Master Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001); 00300601EnronCorpDES.doc 2 the Forward Sale Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001); and REVISED3.DOC 3 the Agency Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001); PhysMstrvAgency.doc Please note the following: 1. General - I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements. In order to ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible, certain elements of the physical metal Master Agreement (for example, conditionality of Transactions/Call Options on hedging) may have to be included in a separate side letter. - To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this transaction, I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master Agreement. - These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject to their comments. 2. Master Agreement - As the Commodities will not be exchange traded, I have introduced the concepts of ""Reference Price"" and ""Pricing Date"", which are similar to those contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions. - Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactions/exercise Call Options on non-Business Days. - I have, where possible, avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the Forward Sale Agreement. However, one aspect of the Agency Agreement that does remain in the Master Agreement is that of ""Agency Costs"", which is, in some instances, an intrinsic element of pricing. This will need to be discussed. - I have removed the concept of ""Minimum Value"", which I understand will not form part of this transaction. - I understand that, due to the nature of the Commodities, there may be an imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered. Although the consequences of this need to be discussed, I have introduced provisions to cater for this (see Clauses 4.3 and 5.5.5). 3. Forward Sale Agreement - I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the Agency and the Master Agreements. - The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed. - I have removed ""Credit Support Default"" as an Event of Default. 4. Agency Agreement - As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements, I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible. I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this transaction.

When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other than sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any faith or could agree on a pricing index. Fortunately, the market is starting to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here shortly.

Names of the panellists are available from the Baltic Exchange website (www.balticexchange.com) and in the manual for the panellists. When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are assessed daily by the Baltic Exchange. This report comes out every day at 11:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done. The tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent. 1 in Norway 1 in France 1 in the U.S. 5 in London As you can see, it is more popular in London. This relates to the exact same concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight market. The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 route - 70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Christi - described as caribs to USG. The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt. As u can see by the last posting (May 11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 p/mt flat which  1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo  107,100 USD; vice versa if you bought at ws 190. The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont). We have a trading department here that should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight. In addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems. 90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the international owners have commercial representation in the States. Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months time - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market when broken down. For example: Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a ""last done"" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days. 70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl market. Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 x 70,000 mt  513,000 bbls. This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc... This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of buyers. When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in. (I apologize if this is remedial for any readers) In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight which means rates will swing hard. Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x ws 160 level. On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, or the T9 route. For the most part the breakdown is as follows : Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they deliver them cpp from the USG. Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc. Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc.. Columbia - same players (We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.) Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to them. Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading. Some of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s). For example, Lyondell has a C.O..A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves p/mo.) for 2 years. The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flows. Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal with on physical vessel trading. In addition, the freight people are not going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that trading Department Heads might have. In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combined result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.America. Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off we would once again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets. The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank. Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership. FIynn presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July. The pricing would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done. This is always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals concluded overall. Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment. For it would be in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel. If this was to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futures rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific day close's, first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers weren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing tool, who knows what can be done. The last time we tried to get this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost momentum with legal. Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here. Scott advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow now. I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.","Mark Taylor","Michael A Robison","","","2001-05","2001","per call forwarded mark carlos enronxgate mark kevin enronxgate line

For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots. The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the accountability levels. These are: Any one month All months Crude oil 10,000 20,000 Unleaded gasoline 5,000 7,000 Heating oil 5,000 7,000 Natural gas 7,000 12,000 Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped. There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts). These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract. These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation.

E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy  and public utility law.   October 31, 2001   RISK CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENRON COUNTERPARTIES:  FAILURE TO EXERCISE RIGHTS MAY CONSTITUTE WAIVER    The reduction by Moody's Investor Service Inc. of Enron Corp.'s  senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1 this week may be an  issue of concern for companies that are counterparts to Enron obligations.  This downgrade may have immediate consequences under existing transactions  with Enron given that its current credit rating is now two levels above  non-investment grade. Any further downgrade into non-investment grade  levels could seriously affect relationships between counterparties and  Enron, and possibly Enron counterparties and their counterparties.   Enron is the principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and  natural gas trades in the United States. For Enron's power and gas  trading counterparties, a credit event such as a downgrade by Moody's may  precipitate certain obligations under the terms of their trading  transactions. For example, any downgrade, not just a downgrade resulting  in a sub-investment grade rating, may entitle a counterparty to require  Enron to provide additional credit in support of Enron's purchase  obligations. Counterparties should examine all power, gas or other  commodity purchase and sale documentation to confirm whether they possess  this right. The failure to exercise this right may constitute a waiver  and foreclose access to critical performance and payment assurance,  threatening to alter the risk assessment and mitigation considerations  upon which the transactions were originally based. Furthermore, a failure  to declare a credit event or default against Enron could cause a default  on the part of the counterparty itself in collateral or ancillary  arrangements, such as its financing. The potential for a domino effect,  causing defaults or credit events in a series of transactions, is  considerable.   It is uncertain whether Enron's efforts to obtain new lines of  credit will be sufficient to overcome the current difficulties.  Regardless, it is prudent to review the terms of existing transactions  with Enron or its affiliates, including any guarantees or other forms of  corporate credit support. It is also advisable to examine the terms of  transactions dependent on, or otherwise ancillary to, transactions with  Enron or its affiliates to avoid any consequential effects of the Enron  credit ratings downgrade.   For further information on how Enron's current financial situation  could impact your firm's transaction risk profile, please contact Michael  Zimmer at 202.452.7055 or michael.j.zimmer@bakernet.com, Jonathan W.

Cc: Webb, Jay; Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: RE: eNYMEX Brad, We may consider targeting a wide audience. Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse. Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees). I have two primary documents. One is the spec sheet and a general scope. The other is a turbine purchase agreement. A counterparty can have two options: One is to contact us to provide a bid. There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case. Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract. For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence. The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period. It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine. Is this consistent with EOL's format?

But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close. If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information. Thoughts?

The turbines idea on EOL. I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves. So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product. They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada. You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc. But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now. Another item: I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline. Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets. I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak. I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up?

OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate. 2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg? What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty. From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues. Please comment. Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle. Is this possible? Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali; Juggins, Janine; Nelson, Roderick Subject: RE: Trades as ENA Russell My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 1. C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2. Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3. ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali Subject: FW: Trades as ENA Everyone - Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well. As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option. From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will be incorrect. From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this. These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side.

The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London). The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position. Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC. Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office. We were wondering about a couple of things: Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Names of the panellists are available from the Baltic Exchange website (www.balticexchange.com) and in the manual for the panellists. When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are assessed daily by the Baltic Exchange. This report comes out every day at 11:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done. The tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent. 1 in Norway 1 in France 1 in the U.S. 5 in London As you can see, it is more popular in London. This relates to the exact same concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight market. The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 route - 70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Christi - described as caribs to USG. The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt. As u can see by the last posting (May 11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 p/mt flat which  1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo  107,100 USD; vice versa if you bought at ws 190. The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont). We have a trading department here that should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight. In addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems. 90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the international owners have commercial representation in the States. Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months time - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market when broken down. For example: Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a ""last done"" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days. 70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl market. Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 x 70,000 mt  513,000 bbls. This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc... This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of buyers. When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in. (I apologize if this is remedial for any readers) In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight which means rates will swing hard. Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x ws 160 level. On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, or the T9 route. For the most part the breakdown is as follows : Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they deliver them cpp from the USG. Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc. Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc.. Columbia - same players (We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.) Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to them. Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading. Some of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s). For example, Lyondell has a C.O..A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves p/mo.) for 2 years. The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flows. Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal with on physical vessel trading. In addition, the freight people are not going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that trading Department Heads might have. In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combined result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.America. Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off we would once again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets. The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank. Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership. FIynn presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July. The pricing would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done. This is always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals concluded overall. Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment. For it would be in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel. If this was to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futures rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific day close's, first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers weren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing tool, who knows what can be done. The last time we tried to get this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost momentum with legal. Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here. Scott advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow now. I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.","Mark Taylor","Cassandra Schultz","","","2001-05","2001","forwarded mark carlos enronxgate mark kevin enronxgate line petroleum

General - I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements. In order to ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible, certain elements of the physical metal Master Agreement (for example, conditionality of Transactions/Call Options on hedging) may have to be included in a separate side letter. - To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this transaction, I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master Agreement. - These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject to their comments. 2. Master Agreement - As the Commodities will not be exchange traded, I have introduced the concepts of ""Reference Price"" and ""Pricing Date"", which are similar to those contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions. - Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactions/exercise Call Options on non-Business Days. - I have, where possible, avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the Forward Sale Agreement. However, one aspect of the Agency Agreement that does remain in the Master Agreement is that of ""Agency Costs"", which is, in some instances, an intrinsic element of pricing. This will need to be discussed. - I have removed the concept of ""Minimum Value"", which I understand will not form part of this transaction. - I understand that, due to the nature of the Commodities, there may be an imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered. Although the consequences of this need to be discussed, I have introduced provisions to cater for this (see Clauses 4.3 and 5.5.5). 3. Forward Sale Agreement - I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the Agency and the Master Agreements. - The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed. - I have removed ""Credit Support Default"" as an Event of Default. 4. Agency Agreement - As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements, I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible. I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this transaction.

Subject: FW: Chiricahua Assignments Brent, Please review the attached suggested changes to the assignment agreement. I have made changes to only one of the agreements, but I assume that any changes designated below will be made to both agreements. Broadly speaking, my changes are designed to accomplish the following: 1. We want to characterize the Chricicahua LLCs as ""Purchasers"" to the extent possible and not an assignor. Much of the redefined terms seek to accomplish that objective. 2. The stated intent of Chircahua is to ""invest"" in the Transactions. This language tries to bolster our argument that Chiricahua is wanting to invest in the weather derivatives market but in so doing it is not acting as a market maker with customers in these instruments. I have no changes to the Master Agreement and expect that we want to minimize any changes to the extent possible. I am happy, however, that we are trying to execute separate masters and not simply amend ENA's existing master.

These two entities are ultimately wholly owned subsidiaries of ENA. It is intended that these entities will also enter into a few weather transactions directly with XL Trading Partners Ltd. All of these transactions must have a term that ends no later than midnight December 31 2001. My understanding is that some time after these transactions are assigned or entered into the Chiricahua entities will be liquidated sometime during the month of December and the weather transactions will be transferred to the parent entity which will subsequently be liquidated and moved to its parent and so on until the transactions end up at ENA. I would ask Bret or Steve to clarify the process to the extent that I have left anything out or misstated the proposal in broad terms.

It might be a good idea to try and get the ISDA team to spend a little time on non-financial commodities. It's not clear from this summary that they intend to raise energy commodity derivatives as an issue or attempt to achieve parity of legal treatment with bank products. Just so you know, we have run into this kind of blind spot from local participants (who are mostly banks and investment firms) before but the New York ISDA staff is usually willing to help us out. -----Original Message----- From: Arap, Sami Sent: Friday, September 28, 2001 2:56 PM To: Collonges, Remi; Rosenberg, David; Gonzalez, Orlando Cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ENRON; Hendry, Brent; Kimball, Mary Subject: RE: Brazilian Conference Call FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Sami Arap/SA/Enron on 09/28/2001 05:04 PM --------------------------- Lavinia.Junqueira@itau.com.br on 09/28/2001 01:54:00 PM To: Scott Marra SMARRA@isda.org, anibal.fernandez@itau.com.br, genovadiane@jpmorgan.com, jimenezemilio@jpmorgan.com, KSumme@isda.org, mark.e.headicke@enron.com, marta.alves@itau.com.br, oliveirarogerio@jpmorgan.com, PMARTINEZ@isda.org, RAinslie@isda.org, ricardo.salaman@gs.com, robert.mancini@gs.com, sami.arap@enron.com, samuel.ramos@gs.com, santoscarlos@jpmorgan.com, yuri.okumura@gs.com cc: Subject: RE: Brazilian Conference Call Dear Sirs, With regard to ISDA visit to Brazil and as discussed in our conference call today, we would like to summarize the issues that we believe might be important to raise with the Brazilian authorities as well as market participants. We added some additional points as we realized might be interesting to discuss: I. ISDA Master Agreement and International Market Practice x Local Masters and Brazilian Market Practices a) Differences as to events of default, early termination, suspension of contracts or valuations, etc. due to differences in market practices - discussion of contrasts; b) Definitions of events of default and early termination and reflex in other local primary market agreements (loans, derivatives) - preparation for trigger events of credit derivatives. c) Should the master agreement be recognized by the authorities as an official way to negotiate derivatives (ie. By creating a special regulatory treatment, etc.) or should it be used voluntarily by market participants as currently assumed? II. ISDA Definitions of local rates, indexes, commodities, securities: liquidity of local and international derivatives market referenced to Brazilian financial instruments. a) Contribution of ISDA to the negotiation of derivatives referenced to Brazilian instruments. b) Contribution of the authorities (ie. expansion of the scope to the negotiation of international hedging derivatives by Brazilian banks and counterparties). III. Netting and Banking Credit Bills (c?dulas de cr?dito banc?rio). a) Instability of Provisional Measure x Contractual Reliability - power of law x weakness of legislative trust - stability of contractual relations x change in law b) Negotiations of legislative approvals c) Independence of the Brazilian Central Bank and Monetary Council Parallel in other legislation x benefits to the market x constraints to the market IV. OTC Derivatives x Clearings a) Should all OTC Derivatives be registered in local clearances as the authorities require ? - pros and cos b) Tax effects and gambling characterization of unregistered contracts ? V. Discussion of tax deviations that affect the derivatives industry. a) Financial institutions: non-hedging transactions b) Non-financial companies: hedging transactions Feel free to contact us if you need any further explanations !

If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow. I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk. I'm thinking of something to the effect of: Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order. For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active. Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level. That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty. The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as: 'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.

The documents which need to be executed are :- 1. Novation Agreement  You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal  Compliance in NY soon  This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW books into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA  To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail) 2. Credit Support Annex  Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom and return via fax  As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need to novate the collateral as well. 3. Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp  To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS 4. RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement  See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement letter.  This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names have to be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be distributed to your payments division.  Please sign and return by fax Please let me know if you have any queries at all. All documents can be returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter. One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all documents to be returned. Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a realistic date for return.

The primary reason for this is the way Tudor - and most of these funds - are set up. Normally the funds have at least two separate entities, one onshore and one offshore, so that they can attract both US and overseas investors. We have separate ISDAs w/ each fund, yet in practice the fund manager will trade, say, 100 lots which is then split in some way between the two funds. While this works in practice right now, with the funds calling in and us executing orders, it would not work at present on EOL unless they traded as separate entities. Because one manager/trader usually trades on behalf of both entities, he would have to be clicking on two separate EOL screens to trade. When I spoke w/ Larry 2 weeks ago, he asked whether the funds could trade on EOL through only one of the two entities. I brought this up w/ them and the reply was that it's not possible. The reason is that the funds are set up legally according to certain guidelines, one of which is that trades are allocated among the various funds according to capital in each fund. To put all of one trade in one fund would violate those guidelines, as the manager would be favoring one class of investors - say, foreign ones if it were only the offshore fund that traded on EOL - over another by putting all of one trade in one fund. If the trade was a winner, the foreign investors would benefit more than domestic ones. If it's a loser, it would be the other way around. The way we're proceeding to work around this is to draft an a legal agreement that basically gives one entity (a ""superfund"") the ability to trade on EOL on behalf of all the funds with which we have ISDAs. We have spoken to the funds about this, as well as to Dan Diamond and Savita Puthigai from EOL, and all have agreed that this is the best way forward. There are two funds that we deal w/ which have only one entity, which would make transacting on EOL much easier. One of those - Harvard - already has transaction rights on EOL. Harvard, however, is not going to be a flow customer, which is why I noted above that Tudor is really the first fund that will transact regularly on EOL. Harvard's focus is longer term and typically more option-oriented. The one thing they might trade on a more frequent basis - as I mentioned to Larry - is the WTI/Brent spread. Other funds have expressed interest in seeing this product online as well. The second fund we are still negotiating an ISDA with, but that should be signed within the next 2 weeks. As you can see, the funds are not all set up the same way. Moreover, many have different focuses - i.e. short-term, longer-term, fundamentally driven, technically-driven, etc. Some are also restricted by their charter from trading prompt-month instruments. Our goal is to get all of them set up on EnronOnline; but not all of them will be flow customers. All the funds currently have guest IDs on EOL. We worked an arrangement w/ Dave Forster and Mike Bridges of EOL under which the funds' guest accounts are good for 2-6 months. So the funds are seeing EOL prices, and we very often transact on those prices - at this point more on the gas side than crude. However, recent trades we have initiated on the crude/products side - for example, a Cal02 fuel oil crack - have been done b/c a fund has seen the price on EOL. Moreover, trades we pitch are often referenced to EOL prices, so that the funds can monitor them for their desired levels. Chris Glaas has visited many of the funds to pitch his EOL DFL product, which would allow them to more easily and transparently play in the Dated Brent market. So has Andy James, from the shipping group, who was pitching both dry bulk cargo and wet tanker route markets on EOL. When we last spoke, Larry introduced me to the TAS gasoline product. We're definitely interested in the new products that are out there, and are happy to talk to the funds about specific ones. As far as internal problems, the only one we have is the lack of adequate numbers of legal staff to draft and negotiate ISDAs and these EOL omnibus agreements w/ the funds. ENA/EGM has assigned one lawyer to us - Frank Sayre - and he is also saddled w/ other responsibilities so that his time is very constrained. Just to summarize, as far as status on EOL, all the funds except Harvard have guest IDs for EOL. We have signed ISDAs w/ five and are negotiating ISDAs w/ seven more. In addition, we are in discussion w/ two other funds. Three of the funds - one with which we're negotiating an ISDA and the two with which we're in discussion - are program (""black box"") funds. Our specific pitch to them was EOL, as it has more transparent pricing and often tighter spreads than they see on the floor. Of all the funds, these we expect would provide the most flow business to EOL. Sorry for the long explanation to a short request - if you have more questions I'd be happy to discuss them over the phone. I'm at 212 702 3914.

I found this one in my in-box when I got back this morning. Is it yours? ----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 05/22/2001 09:35 AM ----- ""Deborah V. Chapman"" debchapman@eircom.net 05/17/2001 04:52 PM To: ""Mark Taylor (E-mail)"" mtaylo1@ei.enron.com cc: Subject: Graham's leaving date Dear Mark, Thanks for keeping us updated on Tom. I am pleased to hear that he is making a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there. I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer so that I can feel the benefit of it. I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some help. Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking piling up). At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy. We will look forward to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.

Attached please find the end user letters objecting to some of the proposed changes to the ISDA Master Agreement. As I mentioned, MFA, the UK Association of Corporate Treasurers, the Committee for the Investment of Employee Benefit Assets (CIEBA) and the End Users of Derivatives Council (the old EUDA) have all sent letters to ISDA saying that they have problems with some of the proposed changes. We met with ISDA once, back in March. CIEBA and EUDC have both asked for meetings with ISDA. Not sure if there has been any meetings or whether they are scheduled. Obviously we believe that the documents need to be fair to end users. We believe it is in ISDA's best interests to not go forward with changes which end users object to. Any assistance you can provide on this point would be appreciated.

Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period, provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction. The Fixed Price shall be equal to the Flat Rate (as defined below) multiplied by the percentage submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline. The Notional Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline. The Floating Price shall be the Index. The Payment Date shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable. The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date (or start date) to the Termination Date (or end date). The Effective Date (or start date) is 01 Dec 2001. The Termination Date (or end date) is 31 Dec 2001. The Index shall be the arithmetic average of the prices in the Determination Period. Such prices shall be calculated by multiplying the Flat Rate (as defined below) for the route known as ""70,000 tonnes loading Puerto La Cruz to Corpus Christi"" by the World Scale (or ""WS"") under the heading 'The Baltic International Tanker Route (BITR) Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (BDTI); Route 9' whenever published by The Baltic Exchange Limited within the Determination Period. The Flat Rate is the rate in US dollars per metric tonne as published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc. in effect on the last day of the Determination Period for the above mentioned route. If for any reason the Baltic Exchange Limited does not provide any prices during the Determination Period, then the Forward Freight Agreement Brokers Association (""FFABA"") may be instructed by either Enron or Counterparty to form a panel to establish such price, which will be binding on both Counterparty and Enron. The price quoted on EnronOnline is World Scale (or ""WS""), expressed as a percentage of the Flat Rate. The Contractual Currency will be US dollars. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be metric tonnes and the quantity shown shall be the number of LOTs per Determination Period (each LOT being 5000 metric tonnes).

It would be extremely challenging commercially. How do we convince customers to participate? Two distinct areas: (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business. New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit? Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades. Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit. But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate? This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle. Issues: Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts. Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate? Might make more sense where no current positions exist. Contract hurdles: Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default. Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC. May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work). If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money? It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties. That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch. Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers? If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch. (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?) Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC. If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts. When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market. Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this. -----Original Message----- From: Kitchen, Louise Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 10:03 AM To: Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: FW: VMAC Transaction -----Original Message----- From: Eichmann, Marc Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 2:51 PM To: Kitchen, Louise; Lavorato, John Cc: Richter, Brad Subject: VMAC Transaction Louise and John: Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal. Here are the deal highlights: FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows: 1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions. 2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis. FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position ($1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position ( $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant. FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. Please find enclosed the following: 1) Transaction structure : Describes the payment logic in case of default 2) Terms and conditions : Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract 3) Collateral Haircuts : Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money) 4) FSA snapshot 5) FSA rating: AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's Please feel free to contact me or Brad Richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this, Marc Eichmann Work 713 345-8422, Cell 713 870-2696 Manager Transaction Development EnronOnline LLC  File: VMAC Transaction structure.doc   File: VMAC Term and Conditions.doc   File: Collateral Haircuts.doc   File: FSA snapshot.doc   File: FSA rating.pdf","Mark E (Legal) Taylor","Mark E (Legal) Taylor","","","2001-11","2001","think real possibility would extremely challenging commercially convince customer participate two distinct area existing portfolio business new business new business easier sense since everything money would say aaa credit still requires significant amendment existing trading documentation existing trade present separating netting new trade existing business easy counterparties already money want improved credit convince money side equation participate seem biggest hurdle issues requires consent customer significant amendment existing contract adequate incentive customer currently money participate might make sense current position exist contract hurdle need allow termination defaulting party vmac able control termination default need consent counterparty assign contract vmac may require changing permitted credit support counterparties letter credit probably work attempting put existing book business structure initial chunk money given vmac secure existing money side portfolio much money clear proposal allows credit line counterparties given aggregate million credit line money counterparties given aggregate million credit line money counterparties vmac satisfied mismatch continue control amount credit give customer collateral requirement participating transaction solved since mismatch customer agree collateral requirement credit line portfolio money post collateral vmac fail vmac default contract contract terminated defaulting party payment counterparties calculated side market presumably vmac require cushion cover message kitchen louise sent tuesday november taylor mark legal vmac transaction message eichmann marc sent wednesday november kitchen louise lavorato john richter brad vmac transaction louise john general description transaction negotiating vmac virtual markets assurance corporation financial securities assurance fsa aaa rated insurance company large enough provide credible deal deal highlight fsa would wrap credit exposure follows case default fsa would liquidate contract sleeved use proceeds money transaction pay money transaction case money portfolio trade sleeved vmac fsa would pay counterparties collateral previously posted managed day day basis fsa mentioned possibility extending line credit based net collateral position billion today net mark market position billion date haircuts line credit would negotiated might significant would receive compensation fee structure described term condition current structure risk vmac exposed risk simultaneous default another counterparty operational risk marking market position liquidating contract please find enclosed following transaction structure describes payment logic case default terms condition describes term condition negotiation contract collateral haircuts describes collateral haircut security posted fsa guarantee net mark market position money fsa snapshot fsa rating aaa qualification fsa moody please feel free contact brad richter clarify doubt respect marc eichmann work cell manager transaction development enrononline llc file vmac transaction file vmac term file collateral file fsa file fsa","vmac transaction"

However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.

Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades. The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade. We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade. This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part. This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you a copy if you want it). But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake. Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed. In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind. One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's ""completed transactions"" section as if it had never happened. As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice. -----Original Message----- From: Boyd, Justin Sent: Wednesday, September 26, 2001 8:55 AM To: Taylor, Mark E (Legal) Subject: EOL Mark We do have mistakes from time to time, as you suspected.

LGE's hedge plan is based on the use of call options. The Public Service Commission is expected to act on that proposal in the next few days. Chris Balmer, Pam Jaynes, and I will be giving you a call on Tuesday to discuss LGE's hedging plan, seek your comments, and address any issues or concerns you may have in advance of actually sending out the bid letters. We believe it will be useful to seek your input and answer any questions you may have at this point, since once regulatory approval is received the time to implement the program, seek bids, and consummate transactions will all have very short turn around times. Attached are two documents which will be the basis of that discussion. The first is a draft Bid Letter and the second is the General Terms and Conditions under which the call options will be purchased.

Please help ensure that each transaction entered into by Enron and its subsidiaries complies with the agreement, and particularly Section 7.1 of the agreement relating to conduct of business. Peter del Vecchio (at ext. 39875) and Joe Henry (at ext. 51549) are available to help address specific questions regarding our interim operations. Rob Walls, John Ale, Mark Haedicke and myself are also available, and we will help determine if we need Dynegy's consent for any particular proposed transaction. We are in the process of summarizing the interim covenants, as well as establishing certain procedures to ensure our compliance. I anticipate distributing these items on Thursday. We are also having prepared a memorandum regarding certain anti-trust and other issues that we need to consider in any involvement we have with Dynegy regarding our respective operations.

Logo Spread 1 Managing Price Risk For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions. Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows. Now there's help. For many years, Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using EnronOnline, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products. Spread 2 Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained. Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to Enron. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with Enron. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure. Spread 3 SWAPS Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed. The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party. Spread 4 Swap: Producer example AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target. chart 1 DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP: ? AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices. ? On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread. ? For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to Enron. ? AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target. Spread 5 Swap: End-user example FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales. chart 2 DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP: ? FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices. ? On a monthly basis, FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia. ? For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to Enron. ? The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton. ? The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices. Spread 6 CAPS  FLOORS Like Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price ""insurance,"" i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential. With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements. Spread 7 Cap: End-User example CropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay. To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked. The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton. chart 3 DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT: ? CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices. ? Enron receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap. ? If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, Enron will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock. ? The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap. ? CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process. Spread 8 Floor: Producer example AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time. To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton). chart 4 EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR: ? AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices. ? Enron receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor. ? If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium. ? If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from Enron. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium. ? In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

Paul Kauffman is trying to get the Govenor to support his ideas regarding the RTO in the West and we are working with them to manage some of their price risk on their royalties as well as support our development efforts in the state. One thing that would help us in our relations is to help the Govenor's staff understand Enron's market making capabilities.

Reg. 34042, 6/26/01). Those amendments would implement CFMA Section 203, which allows futures commission merchants and introducing brokers that are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to register with the SEC as broker-dealers for the limited purpose of effecting transactions in certain security futures products. SEC registration in such cases would be accomplished by filing notice with the SEC. In addition, the SEC proposed a conditional exemption from registration under 1934 Securities Exchange Act Section 15(a). The proposed exemption would ""provide guidance on the extent to which a broker-dealer registered by notice may trade security futures products,"" the SEC said. It would allow a broker-dealer registered by notice to trade any security futures products as long as the broker-dealer did not become a member of a registered national securities exchange or national securities association. Finally, the commission proposed changes to Regulation S-P, which was adopted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. ""These amendments would revise certain provisions of Regulation S-P in light of section 124 of the CFMA, which makes the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act applicable to activity regulated by the CFTC."" These amendments would permit futures commission merchants and introducing brokers registered by notice with the SEC as broker-dealers to comply with Regulation S-P by adhering to the CFTC's financial privacy rules, the SEC said.

Our primary concern has not been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because of the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible waiver of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or handled carefully. These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls generally.

It seemed to me that the form they are using may have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is not a drafting exercise on a case by case basis. Practically, to the extent that the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no substantive concern. However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in commodity markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circumstances where their credit is getting ""tight"", I can see the lack of contractual compliance perhaps being problematic. Can somebody in your group develop a template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under the Enron form, the ""industrial"" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.

A few words of encouragement from the Canadians:   A TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES  This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.   America: The Good Neighbor.   Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a  remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a  Canadian  television commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant  remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:   ""This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the  most  generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.   Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted  out  of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars  and  forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying  even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.   When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans  who  propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the  streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.   When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that  hurries  in to help. This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by  tornadoes. Nobody helped.   The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars! into  discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing  about  the decadent, warmongering Americans.   I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the  erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any  other  country  in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed  Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do  all  the International lines except Russia fly American Planes?   Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on  the  moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk  about German technocracy, and you get automobiles. You talk about  American  technocracy, and you find men on the moon -! not once, but several times  -  and safely home again.   You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store  window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not  pursued  and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they  are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa  at  home to spend here.   When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down  through  age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania  Railroad  and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose.  Both are still broke.   I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other  people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced  to  the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even  during  the San Francisco earthquake.   Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned  tired  of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with  their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose  at  the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada  is  not one of those.""   ---  Incoming mail is certified Virus Free.  Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).

In the future, we will not be generally requiring legal opinions to be delivered with the Deemed Isdas (we may however require them on a case by case basis). We will still require legal opinions with the Master Agreements. Also, as you all know one of the problems to get from Mexican counterparties is the agent for service of process. In the future we will be sending as part of our package the names, fees and form of contracts for three agents for service of process. All the Mexican counterparties need to do is to choose one, sign the contract (it is normally one page by fax) and send it in. Because this will expedite our counterparties getting agents for service of process, I will start to ask for such information both in the Deemed Isda and the Master. Finally, I just contacted the confirm desk to ask them to, in the future, always inform me of any Deemed Isdas they get executed from mexican counterparties. Like this I can know and let you know exactly who is signing these documents and who is not. Ideally, we should get these back within a matter of two to three days. If not we should at least attempt to start contacting the counterparties. Just in case you are wondering why I am so concerned about the deemed Isda. Before we have a Deemed Isda executed, if there is a problem, I will have to litigate in Mexico under Mexican law (ENA does not like this option). Only after I get an executed Deemed Isda, I am out of Mexican courts and Mexican law. let me know if you have any questions and or suggestions to optimize our process.

VICTORIA ISLAND. LAGOS. BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP I am NURA USMAN, a management consultant in the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), I am a member of the Tenders Board a Committee in charge of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals (C A P A). I got your contact during my quest for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (DPR) among which were; 1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation. - USD$2 Billion. 2) Contract for Turn around Maintenance (TAM) at the various Refineries in the country. 3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots) -USD$94 Million. The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the tune of Thirty Six million, Five Hundred and sixty one thousand United States Dollars (USD$36,561,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the project officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance 70% to us in due course, or as will be advised in due course. You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following terms and conditions; Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy. Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that the risk involved with your role shall be reduced to the barest minimal. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide beneficiary of the funds. Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years of meritorious service to my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite action as we are well behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the Second quarter of the 2001 fiscal year contractual payments.

If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether. We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis. We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week. Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate. Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather). The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered. This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process. The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people. Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis. If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations. Hope this is helpful. Let me know if it makes sense to you. Mark P.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me. There are two Mark Taylors and we're hard to tell apart. The other guy has his middle initial (""A"") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine. My name usually has my phone number next to it.

Currently we generate approximately 40-50 confirmations each day between ECC and ENA/RMT, which creates some significant administrative and filing burdens. I am generally aware, but not precisely clear on the details, that there has been a recent decision that for certain counterparties, or at least with respect to EOL transactions, that Confirms are no longer necessary. If in fact this is the case, can we do away with the formal confirmation procedures between ECC and ENA/RMT where there is not likely to be any dispute. Morris/Laura, if we do away with the formal confirms between ECC and ENA/RMT, and provided that we have a TAGG or Sitara Deal Ticket, is there any ancillary tax purpose for generating confirms between ECC and ENA/RMT? 2. In the same vein, for certain non-inter-company financial transactions completed on EOL, I understand that it has been approved not to send Confirms. Again, Mark can you please clarify this policy for me, including how we determine for which counterparties this ought to apply in Canada. It was my (again general) understanding that it may have depended upon the wording of the Master Agreement with the counterparty and/or the volume of transactions executed with the counterparty.

As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke. As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them. Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects. Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action. I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call. Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget. I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved. If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so. Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.

We believe this is responsive to the concerns that were raised, and hope that you agree. I am circulating this to those at yesterday's meeting for whom I have e-mail addresses; I trust you will circulate to others in the PWG. Thanks Mike. Sec. 562 - Timing of damage measurement in connection with protected contracts If the trustee rejects a protected contract or agreement or if a protected counterparty liquidates, terminates, or accelerates such contract or agreement, damages shall be measured as of the earlier of -- (1) the date of such rejection; or (2) the date or dates of such liquidation, termination, or acceleration unless: (A) there are not any commercially reasonable determinants of value as of such date or dates, in which case such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant shall measure damages as of the earliest subsequent date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of value; or (B) there are no determinants of value as of such date or dates, in which case such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant shall measure damages as of the earliest date or dates after, or the latest date or dates before, such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of value. For the purposes of subsection (2), if damages are not measured as of the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration and the trustee challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant, such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant has the burden of proving that there were no commercially reasonable determinants of value or no determinants of value as of such date or dates. Legislative History: Section 910 adds a new section 562 to the Bankruptcy Code providing that damages under any swap agreement, securities contract, forward contract, commodity contract, repurchase agreement or master netting agreement will be calculated as of the earlier of (i) the date of rejection of such agreement by a trustee or (ii) the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration of such contract or agreement. Section 562 provides an exception to the rule in (ii) if there are no commercially reasonable determinants of value as of such date or dates, in which case damages are to be measured as of the earliest subsequent date or dates after such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of value, or if there are no determinants of value as of such date or dates, in which case damages are to be measured as of the earliest subsequent date or dates after such date or dates or the latest date or dates before such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of value. Although it is expected that in most circumstances damages would be measured as of the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration, in certain unusual circumstances, such as dysfunctional markets or liquidation of very large portfolios, there may be no commercially reasonable determinants of value, and in other unusual circumstances, such as war conditions, there may be no determinants of value whatsoever. Measuring damages as of a date or dates before the date of liquidation, termination or acceleration will occur in very unusual circumstances. An example was the need to use the most recent available information for the Kuwaiti Dinar after the virtual disappearance of the currency after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The non-bankrupt party is not given unlimited discretion to determine the date as of which damages are to be measured. Instead, its actions are circumscribed unless there are no ""commercially reasonable"" determinants of value (or no determinants of value whatsoever) for it to measure damages on the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration. The references to ""commercially reasonable"" are intended to reflect existing state law standards relating to a creditor's actions in determining damages. New section 562 provides that if damages are not measured as of the date or dates or liquidation, termination or acceleration and the trustee challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant, such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant has the burden of proving the absence of any commercially reasonable determinants of value or any determinants of value, as the case may be. New section 562 is not intended to have any impact on the determination under the Bankruptcy Code of the timing of damages for contracts and agreements other than those specified in section 562. Also, section 562 does not apply to proceedings under the FDIA, and it is not intended that Section 562 have any impact on the interpretation of the provisions of the FDIA relating to timing of damages in respect of QFCs or other contracts.

Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the creditworthiness of suppliers and customers? 4. Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed? 5.

My understanding was that ""Worldscale"" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price. That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication. I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated. The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index. Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number. That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices ""calculated using the Worldscale Assessments.""

Here are my comments on the Singapore product which I drafted in consultation with Paul Henking/Pat Markey who would be trading the product here. Your views would be most appreciated: 1. 1st para : ""as arranged by Enron Europe Finance  Trading Limited"" would not apply to Singapore and therefore not included. 2. Index defininition: (a) In the 1st sentence, I think reference should be to ""the arithmetic average of quotations"" instead of ""the arithmetic average of the prices"" to be consistent with the other swap products Singapore has on-line. This also distinguishes between a ""quotation"" which is an IITRA published quote and ""price"" which in existing EOL products refers to the bid/offer price on EOL. (b) I understand the bid/offer prices on EOL for freight swaps are quoted in ""Worldscale"" or ""WS"" values instead of US$, hence the 2nd last para which reads : ""The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, expressed as ""Worldscale"" or ""WS"", which shall be the Contractual Currency."" (c) Since both quotations and prices are ""Worldscale"" or ""WS"" values (ie. a flat rate determined by the route X the daily variable rate), I have expressed it as ""The flat rate (expressed as ""Worldscale"" or ""WS"") used in the quotations and to calculate the price..."" so as to clarify that the flat rate is a determinant of the ""quotations"" as well as ""price"". (d) As identified in the Houston product, ""Worldscale"" is published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc. (e) Traders here have picked ""the last day of the Determination Period"" as the day to determine the flat rate (ie. ""WS"") instead of Transaction Date to avoid issues which may arise from ""WS"" amendments occurring in the middle of a Determination Period (eg. whether to take a weighted average when calculating the arithmetic average or would the prevailing rate apply for the whole Determination Period) or between Transaction Date and Effective Date (in the case of forward transactions). Since the flate rate effective on ""the last day of the Determination Period"" was chosen, I left out the language which appears in the Houston/London product : ""including any relevant forthcoming amendments published prior to or on such date which may become effective prior to or on the last day of the Determination Period"". I also didn't entirely understand the reference to ""including"" and whether it was intended to mean that all the flat rates will be taken into account (weighted average?) or just the prevailing one. I understand from Robert that when the London product was drafted, it may not have been brought to Legal's attention that the flat rate may be amended (albeit unlikely), anytime during the year in addition to the annual amendments. Attached for your easy reference is the draft Singapore product long description  File: Freight Swap.doc  Thanks. I look forward to your views.

Basically, FERC did not believe that buying thru EnronOnline was a guarantee that consumers in Oregon would not be harmed. FERC found that There is, for example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline represent prevailing market prices. Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no affiliate abuse. We are not certain, however, that the posted price necessarily represents the market price. While, on the surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact, for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to buy at.

Massey, Linda Breathitt, Pat Wood, III and Nora Mead Brownell. Portland General Electric Company Docket No. ER01-2097-000 Enron Power Marketing, Inc. Docket No. ER01-2103-000 ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT PREJUDICE (Issued July 20, 2001) In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using the EnronOnline trading platform. I. Background On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000 (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market- based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on 1 EnronOnline. This amendment does not supplant the existing provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant, established index. Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make 1 The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks, an Enron Corp. subsidiary. EnronOnline is a free, Internet- based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly online. EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in buying from and selling power to third parties. Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2- and ER01-2103-000 inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions different than those in place but that, they state, will still prevent affiliate abuse. Applicants state that the Commission's requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's requirement that ""PGE post on its website notice of a potential purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not provide for a waiting period before consummating the 2 transaction."" According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the ability to buy or sell power ""from perhaps the largest marketer 3 in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers."" II. Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests Notices of the filings were published in the Federal Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000), and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before June 12, 2001. None was filed. III. Discussion The Commission allows power marketers and their public utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate abuse. As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers (such as a power marketer affiliate). One way in which the Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate 4 sales at an established, relevant market price or index. Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent 5 affiliate abuse. 2 EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4. 3 EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4. 4 See, e.g., DPL Energy, Inc. 90 FERC 61,200 (2000); accord, First Energy Trading Services, Inc., 88 FERC 61,067 at 61,156 (1999). 5 E.g., GPU Advanced Resources, Inc., 81 FERC 61,335 at (continued...) Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3- and ER01-2103-000 Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient protection against affiliate abuse. PGE, when buying from EPMI using EnronOnline, will be required to ""take the transaction price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular 6 location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment."" In 7 addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders or engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction being finalized. Applicants also propose to amend their respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication regarding prices posted on EnronOnline. Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at 5 (...continued) 62,539 (1997) (GPU); Detroit Edison Company, 80 FERC 61,348 at 62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison). In GPU, the Commission allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard supplier agreements. Accord, First Energy Trading  Power Marketing, Inc., 84 FERC 61,214 at 62,037-38, reh'g denied, 85 FERC 61,311 (1998). Detroit Edison provided that a traditional public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non- affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin board. Accord, Jersey Central Power  Light Co., 82 FERC 61,023 at 61,071 (1998); Commonwealth Edison Co., 85 FERC 61,288 at 62,176-77 (1998). 6 EPMI Application at 4; PGE Application at 5. 7 In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or lower than that currently available. Applications at 3. While Applicants do not define ""Limit Order,"" the common understanding is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the order only if certain conditions are met. Generally, a limit order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled. Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4- and ER01-2103-000 the posted price (a price that is offered to all market participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is finalized. Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline, but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE. Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of PGE. In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted electronically and is available to all market participants, Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and conditions that are available to PGE. Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g., protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its 8 transactions with its affiliate EPMI). The thrust of Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for selling power between affiliates. We disagree. While perhaps faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied. There is, for example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline 9 represent prevailing market prices. Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no affiliate abuse. We are not certain, however, that the posted price necessarily represents the market price. While, on the surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact, for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI 10 is willing to buy at. For other transactions through media other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be 8 See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate power sales). 9 See supra note 4 and accompanying text. 10 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a participant. For sales, EPMI is the seller. For purchases, EPMI is the buyer. Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5- and ER01-2103-000 11 willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices. Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non- affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically trade those products to attain similar benefits. Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse. Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed restrictions that would require PGE to simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate offered to the affiliate. The Commission requires that, with respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its electronic bulletin board. But it is unclear whether PGE can or will make the same offer to non-affiliates. Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction. Again, this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above- market prices. The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for inter-affiliate power sales transactions. There is, for example, no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would monitor inter-affiliate transactions. For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse. 11 Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices. Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -6- and ER01-2103-000 The Commission orders: Applicants' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected, without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.

Subject: Limit Order Wash Trades I hope this isn't too late. If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow. I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk. I'm thinking of something to the effect of: Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order. For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active. Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level. That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty. The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as: 'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact. The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.' If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

This is prohibited under our futures agreement. Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances). Man has never claimed that the $25M was ""additional margin"". ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter. ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations. A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year. I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas. However, this information changes frequently.

I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers. Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators. I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing. I don't think we need written opinions of counsel. It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

As it turns out I did not need it for Brad. Brad did ask me to follow up on two items -- Item 1) Brad was interested if we could share a list of people who visited the site. So the users would obviously be a subset of this list. Any thoughts on this matter? If the customer visits would not work then -- Item 2) Brad is interested in a workaround. I shared the idea (at a high level) of a campaign to persuade the users to grant us permission to use their names. Brad wanted to be sure that several points would be addressed with whatever the workaround was. His concerns are as follows: 1) we want to be as unobtrusive to the EOL customers as possible, 2) in any transaction we need to give the customer value, and 3) the EOL customers would need to know how we would use the information if they did grant permission to share their data. Suggested Action: I would like to meet with you to talk further about any workarounds you might suggest which would address these issues. After I have a clear understanding of your workaround which addresses the above issues I can then run it by Brad for his approval and then figure out who best to implement. In this regards do you think we could meet tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. (in your office) for 30 minutes to discuss?

I sent her an e-mail this morning trying to set up a call after the All Employee Meeting because I guessed that she had been looking at our issue from the London side. She is going to call me at 4 p.m. Houston time this afternoon to discuss what she has found out to date. Also, one of the attached e-mails suggests that all the London financially settled contracts will be entered into through EFET LLC (rather than ECTRIC) beginning 1 November. I will confirm that with Janine when I talk with her this afternoon. After reading the attached e-mail string, I still think it makes the most sense to have ENA enter into the transactions with the hedge funds (and thus have the transactions be entered into under the ENA ISDA). This assumes, of course, that (1) the counterparties are US or Bermuda based hedge funds as we discussed yesterday, and (2) the New York or Houston office (rather than the London office) is executing and confirming these transactions. We should confirm these assumptions with Robyn. Do you see any reason why this approach would not work for non-EnronOnline transactions? Also, based on the attached e-mail string, it looks like we're trying to set this up for both EnronOnline and OTC contracts. Were you aware of this? I will give you a call shortly to discuss.

This seems like the simplest solution. If not, I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below. With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such, each risk is laid off to the respective books. In this case, a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA (thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund) and then ENA lays off the relevant risk (in the WTI/Brent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC). The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed, as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA (or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours ?). Russell, do the hedge funds operate only out of New York, or would they operate out of London or other European offices also ? I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be. To clarify, using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence (assuming that traders continue to be based in London). Since a significant proportion of Enron's total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk (any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost).

However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg? What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty. From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues. Please comment. Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle. Is this possible? Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali; Juggins, Janine; Nelson, Roderick Subject: RE: Trades as ENA Russell My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 1. C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2. Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3. ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Cc: Abramo, Caroline; Zivic, Robyn; Diamond, Daniel; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, Wendi; Sharma, Shifali Subject: FW: Trades as ENA Everyone - Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well. As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option. From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will be incorrect. From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this. These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side.

The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London). The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position. Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC. Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office. We were wondering about a couple of things: Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?
